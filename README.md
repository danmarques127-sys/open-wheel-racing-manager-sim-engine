# Open Wheel Racing Manager — Simulation Engine

A **data-driven simulation engine prototype** for an open-wheel motorsport management game.  
This repository focuses on **season simulation**, **championship standings**, **points rules**, and **future systemic expansion** (sponsors, R&D, regulations, AI-generated narratives).

> ⚠️ **Work in progress:** This is an early-stage prototype. Features, structure, and data formats may change as the engine evolves.

---

## ✅ Current Features

- Season simulation (prototype)
- Standings calculation (drivers / teams)
- Configurable points ruleset (including sprint support)
- Data-driven architecture (ScriptableObjects / databases)

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (Planned)

- Calendar & race weekend model (sessions, sprint weekends, formats)
- Driver contracts, salaries, and transfer market
- Sponsors, budgets, and financial systems
- R&D and parts development
- Regulation changes between seasons
- Save / load system
- “History generator” (AI-assisted season storytelling & archives)

---

## 🎯 Project Scope

This repository focuses on **simulation logic and data architecture**, not final UI, visuals, or licensed content.

**Primary goals:**
- Robust season and championship simulation
- Flexible, extensible rulesets
- Manager-game–style systemic depth

**Out of scope (for now):**
- Final UI / UX
- Real-time racing visuals
- Licensed teams, drivers, branding, or trademarks

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Unity (prototype environment)
- C# (game logic and simulation systems)
- ScriptableObjects (rulesets, data, configuration)
