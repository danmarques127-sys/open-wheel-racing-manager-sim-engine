# Open Wheel Racing Manager — Simulation Engine

A **data-driven simulation engine prototype** for an open-wheel motorsport management game.
This repository focuses on **season simulation**, **standings**, **points rules**, and **future expansion** (sponsors, R&D, regulations, AI-generated narratives).

> ⚠️ **Work in progress:** This is an early-stage prototype. Features, structure, and data formats may change.

## ✅ Current Features

- Season simulation (prototype)
- Standings calculation (drivers / teams)
- Points ruleset (including sprint support, if configured)
- Data-driven approach (ScriptableObjects / databases)

---

## 🧭 Roadmap (Planned)

- Calendar & race weekend model (sessions, sprint weekends, etc.)
- Driver contracts, salaries, market
- Sponsors & finances
- R&D / parts development
- Regulation changes between seasons
- Save system
- “History generator” (AI-assisted season storytelling & archives)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Unity (prototype environment)
- C# (game logic)
- ScriptableObjects (data + rulesets)
