  shortHistory: "Aston Martin returned to Formula One under its historic name in
    2021, evolving from the former Racing Point team. While the Aston Martin brand
    dates back to Lionel Martin in 1913, its modern F1 presence is defined by significant
    investment and long-term ambition. Based in Silverstone, United Kingdom, Aston
    Martin is building a state-of-the-art operation aimed at future championship
    contention. Though it has yet to secure a Constructors\u2019 or Drivers\u2019
    title, the team has shown rapid development and competitive potential. Its most
    iconic historical figure remains Sebastian Vettel, whose presence elevated the
    team\u2019s profile. Aston Martin\u2019s identity centers on luxury heritage,
    modern infrastructure, and strategic growth."
