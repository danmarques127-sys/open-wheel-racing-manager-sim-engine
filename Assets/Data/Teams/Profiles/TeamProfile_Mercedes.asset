  shortHistory: "Mercedes traces its motorsport roots to the Silver Arrows of the
    1930s, but its modern Formula One team was established in 2010 after acquiring
    Brawn GP. Headquartered in Brackley, United Kingdom, Mercedes redefined Formula
    One during the hybrid era through unmatched power unit innovation and operational
    precision. The team achieved an unprecedented eight consecutive Constructors\u2019
    Championships (2014\u20132021). Its most iconic driver is Lewis Hamilton, who
    secured six world titles with Mercedes, becoming the most successful driver in
    Formula One history. The Mercedes W11 (2020) is considered one of the most dominant
    cars ever produced, showcasing superior aerodynamics, engine performance, and
    race pace. Mercedes\u2019 legacy is built on engineering discipline, data-driven
    excellence, and sustained dominance at the highest level of the sport."
