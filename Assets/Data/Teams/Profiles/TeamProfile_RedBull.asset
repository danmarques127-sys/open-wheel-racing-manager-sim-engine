  shortHistory: "Red Bull Racing was founded in 2005 by Dietrich Mateschitz, transforming
    the former Jaguar Racing team into a modern Formula One powerhouse. Based in
    Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, Red Bull revolutionized team culture by blending
    innovation, youth development, and aggressive performance philosophy. The team
    achieved championship success in two dominant eras, most notably with Sebastian
    Vettel, who won four consecutive Drivers\u2019 Championships (2010\u20132013),
    and later with Max Verstappen, who led Red Bull into a new era of regulation
    mastery. The RB19 (2023) is widely regarded as one of the most dominant cars
    in F1 history, achieving record-breaking win percentages. Red Bull\u2019s identity
    is defined by aerodynamic innovation, bold leadership, and relentless competitive
    ambition."
