  shortHistory: "Founded in 1993 by Peter Sauber, the Swiss-based Sauber team has
    been a consistent presence in Formula One, known for technical competence and
    driver development. Headquartered in Hinwil, Switzerland, Sauber has played a
    key role in launching the careers of drivers such as Kimi R\xE4ikk\xF6nen. While
    the team has not won championships, its partnership with Audi marks a transformative
    new era, positioning Sauber as a future factory powerhouse. Sauber\u2019s identity
    is defined by engineering precision, stability, and long-term ambition."
