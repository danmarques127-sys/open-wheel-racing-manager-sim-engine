  shortHistory: "Ferrari was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939, with its first Formula
    One entry in 1950, making it the only team to compete in every season of the
    championship. Based in Maranello, Italy, Ferrari embodies the fusion of racing
    passion, engineering heritage, and national identity. The team holds the all-time
    records for most Constructors\u2019 Championships (16) and most Drivers\u2019
    Championships (15). Its most successful driver is Michael Schumacher, who won
    five consecutive world titles (2000\u20132004) with Ferrari, restoring the team\u2019s
    dominance after a long title drought. Among its many legendary cars, the Ferrari
    F2004 is widely regarded as the greatest Ferrari ever built, combining reliability,
    speed, and aerodynamic efficiency to dominate the 2004 season. Ferrari\u2019s
    legacy is defined not only by statistics, but by its emotional bond with fans
    worldwide and its uncompromising commitment to racing excellence."
