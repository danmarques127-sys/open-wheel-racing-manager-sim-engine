  shortHistory: "Founded in 1963 by Bruce McLaren, the McLaren Formula One team is
    one of the sport\u2019s most historic and respected institutions. Based in Woking,
    United Kingdom, McLaren has long been synonymous with technical ingenuity and
    elite driver talent. The team has won eight Constructors\u2019 Championships
    and twelve Drivers\u2019 Championships, with legends such as Ayrton Senna, Alain
    Prost, and Mika H\xE4kkinen driving for the team. Senna is often regarded as
    McLaren\u2019s greatest driver, achieving three world titles with the team. The
    McLaren MP4/4 (1988) stands as one of the most successful cars ever built, winning
    15 of 16 races in a single season. McLaren\u2019s legacy is rooted in innovation,
    precision engineering, and enduring competitiveness."
