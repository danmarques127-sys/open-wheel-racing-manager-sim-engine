  shortHistory: "Racing Bulls, formerly known as Toro Rosso and AlphaTauri, was established
    in 2006 as Red Bull\u2019s junior and development team. Based in Faenza, Italy,
    the team serves as a proving ground for emerging talent and technical experimentation.
    Its most notable achievement came in 2008, when Sebastian Vettel secured a historic
    victory at the Italian Grand Prix, marking the team\u2019s first win. Racing
    Bulls\u2019 legacy lies in driver development, adaptability, and its role as
    a strategic extension of Red Bull Racing."
