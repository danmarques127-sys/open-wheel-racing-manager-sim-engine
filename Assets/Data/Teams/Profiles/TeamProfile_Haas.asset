  shortHistory: "Haas F1 Team was founded in 2016 by American entrepreneur Gene Haas,
    becoming the first American-owned Formula One team in decades. Based in Kannapolis,
    USA, with operational facilities in Europe, Haas adopted a unique business model
    focused on technical partnerships and efficiency. While the team has not won
    championships, it achieved notable success early in its tenure, including consistent
    points finishes and strong midfield performances. Haas\u2019 identity is rooted
    in pragmatic engineering, financial discipline, and steady long-term participation
    in Formula One."
