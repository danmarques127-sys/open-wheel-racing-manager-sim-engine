  shortHistory: "Alpine represents the Formula One identity of Renault, a manufacturer
    deeply embedded in the sport\u2019s history. Renault first entered Formula One
    in 1977 and achieved major success as both a constructor and engine supplier.
    Based in Enstone, United Kingdom, Alpine carries forward this legacy under a
    modern brand. The team has won two Constructors\u2019 Championships and two Drivers\u2019
    Championships, with Fernando Alonso securing both titles in 2005 and 2006. The
    Renault R25 is remembered as a landmark car that ended Ferrari\u2019s era of
    dominance. Alpine\u2019s legacy combines engineering innovation, manufacturer
    expertise, and a proud competitive history."
